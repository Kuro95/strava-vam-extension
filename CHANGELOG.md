and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### üîß Fixed
- **CRITICAL: VAM Calculation Bug** - Fixed major calculation error in VAM computation
  - Now uses CUMULATIVE elevation gain (sum of positive changes) instead of NET gain (end - start)
  - This is the industry-standard method used by Strava, TrainingPeaks, and Sauce for Strava
  - Impact: VAM values now 10-50% more accurate for climbs with descents
  - Pure climbs (no descents) unaffected - same values as before
  - See [docs/VAM_CALCULATION_FIX.md](docs/VAM_CALCULATION_FIX.md) for detailed analysis

### ‚ú® Added
- **Elevation Data Smoothing** - 3-point moving average reduces GPS noise
- **Minimum Thresholds** - Filters unrealistic segments (5m for time/distance, 90% for ascent)
- **Comprehensive Tests** - 14 new tests covering cumulative gain calculation
- **Technical Documentation** - Detailed explanation of fix and impact

### üìà Impact
- Climbs with small descents/switchbacks now show correct VAM (typically 10-30% higher)
- More consistent with other cycling platforms and tools
- Historical PBs preserved (not recalculated) - new activities use correct method
