# Manual Upload to Firefox Add-ons Store

This guide explains how to manually upload a signed extension package (.xpi) to the Firefox Add-ons Store.

## üìã Overview

For the **first submission** or when you need full control over the release process, you should use the manual upload workflow. Once your extension is approved and listed on Mozilla Add-ons (AMO), you can switch to automatic publishing.

## üéØ When to Use Manual Upload

Use manual upload when:
- ‚úÖ Submitting your extension for the **first time**
- ‚úÖ Your extension is not yet **approved** by Mozilla
- ‚úÖ You want to **review** the package before submission
- ‚úÖ You need to upload **source code** separately (for extensions using minification/compilation)
- ‚úÖ Testing a release before automatic deployment

## üöÄ Creating a Signed Release Package

### Option 1: Using GitHub Actions (Recommended)

#### A. Manual Workflow Dispatch
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click **Actions** ‚Üí **Manual Release (Signed XPI)**
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Enter the version number (e.g., `1.0.4`)
5. Click **Run workflow**
6. Wait for the workflow to complete (2-5 minutes)
7. Download the signed `.xpi` from the **Releases** page

#### B. Git Tag Method
```bash
# Make sure your manifest.json has the correct version
# Example: "version": "1.0.4"

# Create a tag with -manual suffix
git tag v1.0.4-manual

# Push the tag to trigger the workflow
git push origin v1.0.4-manual

# The workflow will automatically:
# - Build the extension
# - Run tests and validation
# - Sign the .xpi
# - Create a GitHub release with the signed package
```

### Option 2: Local Build and Sign

If you have Mozilla API credentials set up locally:

```bash
# 1. Build the extension
npm run build

# 2. Validate the package
npm run validate

# 3. Sign the extension (requires API credentials)
npx web-ext sign \
  --source-dir=dist \
  --artifacts-dir=artifacts \
  --channel=unlisted \
  --api-key=$WEB_EXT_API_KEY \
  --api-secret=$WEB_EXT_API_SECRET

# The signed .xpi will be in the artifacts/ directory
```

**Note:** For local signing, you need to:
1. Get API credentials from https://addons.mozilla.org/developers/
2. Set environment variables `WEB_EXT_API_KEY` and `WEB_EXT_API_SECRET`

   ```

4. **Automatic Workflow Will**:
   - Build and test the extension
   - Sign with Mozilla
   - Automatically submit to AMO for review
   - Create GitHub release with artifacts

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "The uploaded file is not a valid extension"

**Causes:**
- Missing `manifest.json` at root level
- Invalid JSON in manifest
- Incorrect file structure

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check file structure
unzip -l artifacts/*.xpi | head -20

# Rebuild if needed
npm run build
npm run package
```

### "This version number is not valid"

**Causes:**
- Version already exists on AMO
- Version format incorrect (must be semver: x.y.z)

**Fix:**
- Increment version in `src/manifest.json`
- Follow semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

### Validation Errors

Check the output of:
```bash
npm run validate
```

Fix any errors before uploading.

### Upload Times Out

- Try a different browser
- Check your internet connection
- Try uploading at a different time
- Contact Mozilla support if persistent
